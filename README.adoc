# Skippifying Spring Boot

Fork used in the tutorial https://www.skippy.io/posts/skippifying-spring-boot.

## Highlights
- Spring Boot can be skippified using 5 lines of configuration changes.
- Skippy’s Test Impact Analysis is shown to be highly efficient for large projects. It handles over 4000 tests and more than 2500 classes with minimal overhead, adding only 23 seconds (or 13%) to the total time compared to ./gradlew check.
- Skippy’s Predictive Test Selection demonstrates its effectiveness in identifying all regressions that are caught when running all tests. This feature reduces the number of tests that need to be executed by 90% to 100% and cuts down the time required for test execution by 84% to 98%.
